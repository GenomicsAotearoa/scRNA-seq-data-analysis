# 4. sctransform: Variant Stabilising Transformation

With scaling normalisation a correlation remains between the mean and variation of expression (heteroskedasticity). This affects downstream dimensionality reduction as the few main new dimensions are usually correlated with library size. `sctransform` addresses the issue by regressing library size out of raw counts and providing residuals to use as normalized and variance-stabilized expression values in some downstream analyses, such as dimensionality reduction.

The `sctransform` package is from the Seurat suite of scRNAseq analysis packages. Rather than convert our Single Cell Experiment object into a Seurat object and use the Seurat package’s command `SCTransform`, we will extract the counts matrix from our SCE object and run the variance stabilising transformation (VST) algorithm, using the `sctranform` package’s vst command, directly on the matrix. We can extract the counts matrix - as a dgCMatrix object sparse matrix - using the `counts function
