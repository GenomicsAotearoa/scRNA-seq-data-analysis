# 10. Differential Abundance


In the previous section we discussed how we can perform differential expression analysis using pseudo-bulk samples, when multiple biological replicates are available in a multi-condition experiment. Differential expression analysis addresses the question of whether a gene has a different average expression between the two groups being compared. However, another useful question to address is whether the cell composition also differs between conditions. We could imagine, for example, that natural killer cells are more abundant in leukemia samples than in healthy samples.

This type of analysis is referred to as **differential abundance analysis**.
