# 7. Clustering

Once we have normalized the data and removed confounders we can carry out analyses that are relevant to the biological questions at hand. The exact nature of the analysis depends on the data set. One of the most promising applications of scRNA-seq is de novo discovery and annotation of cell-types based on transcription profiles. This requires the identification of groups of cells based on the similarities of the transcriptomes without any prior knowledge of the label a.k.a. unsupervised clustering. To avoid the challenges caused by the noise and high dimensionality of the scRNA-seq data, clustering is performed after feature selection and dimensionality reduction. For data that has not required batch correction this would usually be based on the PCA output. As our data has required batch correction we will use the “corrected” reducedDims data.

We will focus here on graph-based clustering, however, it is also possible to apply hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on smaller data sets

## Introduction to Graph-based clustering

Graph-based clustering entails building a nearest-neighbour (NN) graph using cells as nodes and their similarity as edges, then identifying ‘communities’ of cells within the network. A graph-based clustering method has three key parameters:

- How many neighbors are considered when constructing the graph
- What scheme is used to weight the edges
- Which community detection algorithm is used to define the clusters

### Connecting nodes (cells) based on nearest neighbours
Two types of NN graph may be used: “K nearest-neighbour” (KNN) and “shared nearest-neighbour” (SNN). In a KNN graph, two nodes (cells), say A and B, are connected by an edge if the distance between them is amongst the k smallest distances from A to other cells. In an SNN graph A and B are connected if the distance is amongst the k samllest distances from A to other cells and also among the k smallest distance from B to other cells.

In the figure above, if k is 5, then A and B would be connected in a KNN graph as B is one of the 5 closest cells to A, however, they would not be connected in an SNN graph as B has 5 other cells that are closer to it than A.

The value of k can be roughly interpreted as the anticipated size of the smallest subpopulation” (see `scran`’s `buildSNNGraph()` [manual](https://rdrr.io/bioc/scran/man/buildSNNGraph.html)).

The plot below shows the same data set as a network built using three different numbers of neighbours: 5, 15 and 25 (from [here](https://biocellgen-public.svi.edu.au/mig_2019_scrnaseq-workshop/clustering-and-cell-annotation.html#example-1.-graph-based-clustering-deng-dataset)).
