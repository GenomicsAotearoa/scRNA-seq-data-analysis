# 4. sctransform: Variant Stabilising Transformation

With scaling normalisation a correlation remains between the mean and variation of expression (heteroskedasticity). This affects downstream dimensionality reduction as the few main new dimensions are usually correlated with library size. `sctransform` addresses the issue by regressing library size out of raw counts and providing residuals to use as normalized and variance-stabilized expression values in some downstream analyses, such as dimensionality reduction.
