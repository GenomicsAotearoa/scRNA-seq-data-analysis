# Clustering

Once we have normalized the data and removed confounders we can carry out analyses that are relevant to the biological questions at hand. The exact nature of the analysis depends on the data set. One of the most promising applications of scRNA-seq is de novo discovery and annotation of cell-types based on transcription profiles. This requires the identification of groups of cells based on the similarities of the transcriptomes without any prior knowledge of the label a.k.a. unsupervised clustering. To avoid the challenges caused by the noise and high dimensionality of the scRNA-seq data, clustering is performed after feature selection and dimensionality reduction. For data that has not required batch correction this would usually be based on the PCA output. As our data has required batch correction we will use the “corrected” reducedDims data.

We will focus here on graph-based clustering, however, it is also possible to apply hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering on smaller data sets
