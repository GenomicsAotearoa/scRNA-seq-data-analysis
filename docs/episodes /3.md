# Normalisation

    ```r
    library(scater)
    library(scran)

## Load data object 

For the purposes of this demonstration we have generated a smaller data set in which there are only 500 cells per sample. This is so that the code can be run in a reasonable amount of time during the live teaching session. The data were first QC’d and filtered as described in the QC and exploratory analysis session. After this 500 cells were selected at random from each sample.

    sce <- readRDS("R_objects/Caron_filtered.500.rds")

## Why normalise ? 

!!! r-project "code"

    ```r
    oneSamTab <- colData(sce) %>% 
      as.data.frame() %>% 
      filter(SampleName == "PBMMC_1") %>% 
      dplyr::select(SampleName,Barcode, sum) %>% 
      mutate(cell_num = 1:n())
    
    p_before_nom <- ggplot(data=oneSamTab, aes(x=cell_num, y=sum)) +
      geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
      labs( x= 'Cell Index',
            y='Cell UMI counts',
            title = "PBMMC_1: Before Normalization" ) +

        - Above plot shows the UMI counts/cell (transcript molecules) for 500 cell from the PBMMC_1 sample
        
        - UMI counts fluctuate
        
        - We derive biological insights downstream by comparing cells against each other.
        
        - But the UMI counts differences makes it harder to compare cells.
        
        - Why total transcript molecules (UMI counts) detected between cells differ?
        
            - Biological:

                - Cell sub type differences, like size and transcription activity etc.

            - Technical: scRNA data is inherently noisy
                - Low mRNA content per cell
                - cell-to-cell differences in mRNA capture efficiency
                - Variable sequencing depth
                - PCR amplification efficiency
        - A normalization technique makes the UMI counts distribution uniform, so that each cell has similar counts.
        
        - Normalization is a critical step that corrects cell-to-cell technical differences.
         
        - By normalizing, downstream comparisons of relative expression between cells are valid.

## Normalization strategies

!!! rectangle-list "The sparse nature of scRNA data makes normalization difficult, unlike bulk RNAseq data"
    
    - Broadly two classes
        - Spike-in methods
            - Uses pike-in controls for normalisation
            - Not available for droplet based scRNA techniques like 10x.
        - Non-spike-in methods:
            - Using available counts data for normalization
            - DEseq2
            - edgeR - TMM
            - Library size normalization
            - deconvolution
            - sctransform
    
    - Typical normalization has two steps
        - scaling
            - Estimate size or scaling or normalization factor: computation of a cell-specific ‘scaling’ or ‘size’ factor or “normalization factor” that represents the relative bias in that cell and division of all counts for the cell by that factor to remove that bias. Assumption: any cell specific bias will affect genes the same way.
            - Scale the data by dividing the count for each gene with the appropriate size factor for that cell
        - Transformation
            - log2
            - Square root transformation
            - Pearson residuals (eg. sctransform)
