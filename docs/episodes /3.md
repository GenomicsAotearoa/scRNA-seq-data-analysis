## Load data object 

For the purposes of this demonstration we have generated a smaller data set in which there are only 500 cells per sample. This is so that the code can be run in a reasonable amount of time during the live teaching session. The data were first QCâ€™d and filtered as described in the QC and exploratory analysis session. After this 500 cells were selected at random from each sample.

    ```r
    sce <- readRDS("R_objects/Caron_filtered.500.rds")
    sce
    ```
